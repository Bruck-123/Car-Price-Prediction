# Car-Price-Prediction
A machine learning project using Random Forest to predict car prices (0.77 R2 Score).

Car Price Prediction (Machine Learning)This project predicts the selling price of used cars based on features like age, present price, and mileage.
Key Achievements:Data Cleaning: Transformed "Year" into "Age" and used One-Hot Encoding for categorical features (Fuel Type, Transmission).
Model Comparison: Improved $R^2$ score from 0.60 (Linear Regression) to 0.77 (Random Forest).
Algorithms Used: Random Forest Regressor.
